    "At 3rd level, you learn how to craft modifications for your guns. Firearms can have varying numbers of modifications applied to them, which is detailed in the Firearms list. It takes 1 minute to apply or remove a Modification from a Firearm. You learn 4 modifications, and learn more as you progress in the class. Each Firearm you wield can benefit from an additional number of Modifications equal to your Proficiency Bonus.",
