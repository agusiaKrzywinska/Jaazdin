        "Beginning at 1st level, you gain the ability to make sure your shots count. As a Bonus Action, your next ranged attack with a firearm has advantage. If that attack hits, it deals additional damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all spent uses of this ability after you complete a short rest. When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you regain a spent use of this ability."
