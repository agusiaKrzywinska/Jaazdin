    "At 13th level, even death is unable to shake your resolve on the battlefield. When you drop to zero hit points you do not immediately fall {@condition unconscious}, instead you remain conscious until you fail one death saving throw. Additionally, you gain advantage on death saving throws and regain one hit point on a 19 or 20 on a death save."
