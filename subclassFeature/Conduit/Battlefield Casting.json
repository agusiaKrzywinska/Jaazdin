        "At 7th level, you become a master at dealing with magic while in the thick of battle. When you make a Concentration check, you add twice your Constitution modifier to the roll. In addition, if you lose concentration on a spell as the result of failing a Concentration check the spell instead ends at the start of your next turn, or the end of the spell's duration whichever is shorter."
