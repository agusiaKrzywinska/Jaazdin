    "At 15th level, your Virus becomes flesh melting. When a Zombie under your control dies, their body melts. All creatures within 10ft of the Zombie take 2d10 acid damage, and they leave behind a puddle of Necrosis, which appears in a 5ft puddle directly under them. If a creature steps on it, you can immediately have them be affected by a Virus of your choice. The puddle lasts for 1 minute, or until someone steps in it."
