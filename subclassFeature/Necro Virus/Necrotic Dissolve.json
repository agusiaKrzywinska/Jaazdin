        "At 15th level, your Virus becomes flesh melting. When an Undead under your control dies, their body melts. All creatures within 10ft of the Undead take {@dice 2d10} acid damage, and they leave behind a puddle of Necrosis, which appears in a 5ft puddle directly under them. If a creature steps on it, you can immediately have them be affected by a Virus of your choice (ignoring spell school restrictions). The puddle lasts for 1 minute, or until someone steps in it."
