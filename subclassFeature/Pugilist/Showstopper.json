        "At 6th level, you can perform a powerful wind-up punch. You can declare any unarmed attack you make with a Showstopper. A Showstopper deals an additional {@dice 1d4} + your Charisma modifier in damage. If a Showstopper reduces a creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Barbarian level + your Charisma modifier. Regardless if the Showstopper hits or misses, you may attempt to shove or grapple the target as a part of that attack. You can use a Showstopper a number of times per Short or Long rest equal to your Proficiency Bonus.",
        "Additionally, your unarmed strikes are considered magical for the purposes of overcoming resistances."
