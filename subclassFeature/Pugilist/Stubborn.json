    "At 14th level, your hard head keeps you in fights longer than the average battler. If you would drop to 0 hit points or activate Relentless Rage, you can use your reaction to immediately regain a spent use of Showstopper and make a Showstopper attack against a hostile creature within reach. If you would gain temporary hit points from your Showstopper attack, you instead gain that amount as hit points."
