        "At 18th level, you can unleash your entire arsenal. As an Action, select a point within 60ft that you can see. Creatures within a 15 ft radius of this point must make a Dexterity Saving throw, using your Wisdom Modifier to calculate the DC. Creatures that fail take {@dice 12d6} radiant damage, as weapons rain down on them, or half as much on a successful save. Creatures of your choice are immune to this damage. You can use this ability once per long rest."
