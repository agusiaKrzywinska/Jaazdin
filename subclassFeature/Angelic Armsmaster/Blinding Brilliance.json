        "At 10th level, you can perform a Blinding Attack. After hitting a creature with a Weapon of the Gods, you can force that creature and all other creatures within a 10ft radius of it to make a Constitution Saving Throw, using your Wisdom Modifier to calculate the DC (8 + prof + WIS). Creatures that fail are blinded until the end of your next turn. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per short rest.",
