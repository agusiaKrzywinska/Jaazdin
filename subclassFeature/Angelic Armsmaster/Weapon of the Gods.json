        "Beginning at 3rd level, your connection to Celestials can allow you to conjure weapons of Light. You can conduct a 1 hour ritual with a weapon you are holding to convert it into a Weapon of the Gods, at which time it vanishes.",
        "As a Bonus Action, you can conjure one of your Weapon of the Gods. It appears as a glowing and translucent version of that weapon. If the weapon requires ammo, you additionally create a quiver or pouch filled with the required ammunition. This weapon can be dismissed as a Free Action. If the weapon would leave your hands, it disappears after one round. You can only have one weapon conjured at a time.",
        "This weapon deals Radiant damage instead of its normal damage type. Additionally, once per turn you gain a bonus to your damage rolls equal to your Proficiency Bonus when using your Weapon of the Gods.",
        "Finally, you learn the {@spell Light|PHB} cantrip."
