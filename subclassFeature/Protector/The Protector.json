        "To the protector, their bond of protection is the most important thing in the world. To the one they vow to protect they are a guardian and a mentor, not just a protector in battle but a teacher and a friend. Proper guidance in life is as important as a strong shield to protect them in combat. When a protector vows to keep one safe, that bond is unshakable as a mountain.",
        "The longer one serves to protect the same creature, the greater their ability to work together with that creature becomes. A protector and their charge in time become a well-oiled machine, working seamlessly together both in combat and outside it. For a protector, the greatest sin is to let the one they protect die.",
