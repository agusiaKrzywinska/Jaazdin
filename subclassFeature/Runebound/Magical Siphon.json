        "At 14th level, your runic power has manifested fully as a physical rune on your body. You can choose where the rune appears. Your rune becomes a siphon for magical power, as a reaction when you are hit with a spell of 1st level or higher you can use your reaction to draw power from the spell. Make a Spell Casting ability check with a DC equal to 10 + twice the spells level. On a success you regain sorcery points equal to half the spells level, minimum 1."
