    "At 10th level, you become a master of the night. As an Action while raging, you and your equipment can transform into a bat. You return to your normal form either once you drop to 0 hit points, you dismiss it as a Bonus Action, or your rage ends. You retain your mental statistics, and can use your Vampiric Fangs while in this form."
