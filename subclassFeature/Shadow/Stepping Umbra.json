        "Beginning at 10th level, whenever you hit a creature with a melee attack you can use your bonus action to teleport up to 30ft to a point you can see within range. In addition, when you are struck by a ranged attack or spell you can teleport up to 30ft to a point you can see within range. After using this feature, you become resistant to all non-magical damage until the start of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier. You regain all uses on a short rest."
