    "At 14th level, your spellcasting becomes difficult for enemies to keep track of. After an enemy succeeds a Saving Throw against one of your Bard Spells you have casted using a spell slot, that enemy has disadvantage on the next saving throw they make within a minute using that ability score. If that enemy fails the next saving throw they would make using that ability score, they take Psychic Damage equal to your Charisma Modifier x 2."
