    "When you choose this archetype at 2nd level, you gain the ability to magically enchant bullets to produce deadly effects. You learn three Hexed Bullets, as listed in the Hexed Bullets Progression Table, and can produce up to twice your proficiency bonus of those bullets when you finish a long rest. Whenever you finish a long rest, all the Hexed Bullets you have enchanted lose their potency. You learn an additional Hexed Bullet whenever you learn a new tier of firearm.",
    "Prepared Hexed Bullets are placed in a magical receptacle, such as an enchanted bandolier, a special clip, or other magical storage device. As a free action once per turn when you make a ranged weapon attack with a firearm, you can cause one of the prepared Hexed Bullets to teleport into your firearm, enhancing your next attack with that Hexed Bullets effects, and consuming one use of your Hexed Bullets.",
    "Whenever you gain another Gunner level, you can replace a known Hexed Bullet option with another.",
