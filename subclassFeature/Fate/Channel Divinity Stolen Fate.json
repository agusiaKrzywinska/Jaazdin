        "At 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to fix a negative outcome in the potential future. As an Reaction, whenever a creature within 60 ft of you makes an Attack Roll or Saving Throw, you can store that value rolled on the die and replace the die roll with a 10. If you use this Channel Divinity again, you can use the value stored instead of setting it to a 10, replacing their roll with the die value stored. You can only store a die up until you complete a Long Rest."
