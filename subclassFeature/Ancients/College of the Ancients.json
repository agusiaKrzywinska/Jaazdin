    "The College of Ancients is home to the bards whose focus is on the study, understanding, and emulation of ancient myths and histories. These bards spend their time hunting down long-lost ruins, ancient texts, and obscure myths to better understand the history of their world and prevent the mistakes of the past from repeating.",
    "The bards of this college are not always as flamboyant and performative as other colleges. Often, they focus more on perfecting their written word rather than plotting grand performances to awe crowds. These bards are privy to many secret magical talents forgotten to time that allows them to better grasp the histories they study and to warn others of the troubles they may come across now. The greatest bards of these colleges are inspiring historians that have uncovered great truths about the world, but do not stop there because these bards use history to shape their own present as well.",
