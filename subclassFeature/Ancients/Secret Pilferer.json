        "Starting at 14th level, you gain the ability to quickly memorize magic that you see cast or hear cast if it only has a verbal component. As a reaction when you see a spell being cast you can memorize that spell adding it to your spells known. After you have it memorized you can cast the spell as a Bard spell if you have the necessary spell slot needed. You can only have one spell memorized at a time if you memorize a new one you forget the old one. To memorize a spell, you must have at least one spell slot of that level.",
        "In addition, once per long rest when you cast any spell that only has a verbal component it does not use a spell slot."
