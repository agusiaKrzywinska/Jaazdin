        "Starting at 6th level, you can dodge death for a short while. When you are reduced to 0 hit points you are instead reduced to a dark shadowy form. This form has the same effect as the spell gaseous form except you are immune to all damage except radiant. If you take any damage in this form you fail 1 death saving throw. At the end of your next turn you revert to your normal form regaining hit points equal to 1 + your warlock level. Once you use this feature you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest."
