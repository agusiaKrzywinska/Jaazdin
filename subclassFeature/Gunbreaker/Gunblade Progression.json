    "As your skills improve, you learn to modify your Gunblade. As your Gun Tier levels up, your weapon is upgraded into its next tier by paying for the upgrade cost and spending 1 hour using your Gunsmithâ€™s Tools. If you lose or need to replace your special firearm, you can spend 1 hour per Tier it was by crafting a new Gunblade, and the combined gold cost."
