    "At 6th level your body gains the ability to grow as well. You learn the {@spell Enlarge/Reduce} spell, and always have it prepared as a Druid spell for you. You can only cast the Enlarge portion of the spell. Whenever you would attack a creature that is at least a size category smaller than you, you deal an additional {@dice 1d6} damage equal to how many size categories smaller that creature is compared to you."
