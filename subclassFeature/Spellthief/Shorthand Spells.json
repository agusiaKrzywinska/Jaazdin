    "At 2nd level, you become a savant in cramming in spells into your spellbook. When you prepare your Wizard spell, you can also shorthand a number of spells into your spellbook equal to half of your Wizard level, in total Spell Levels (rounded down). You cannot Shorthand the same spell twice, nor can you have a prepared spell also Shorthanded. These Shorthanded spells can be casted once each without using a spell slot, but cannot be cast using your normal spell slots. You can only Shorthand spells equal to or lower than 5th level.",
