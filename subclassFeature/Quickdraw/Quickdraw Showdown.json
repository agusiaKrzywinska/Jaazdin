        "At 6th level, you become incredibly fast at unholstering your weapons. You have advantage on Initiative Rolls, and can take out a firearm or a pair of light firearms as a free action on your first turn in combat. Furthermore, attacking a creature who is yet to act in initiative gives you the upper hand, causing your attacks to deal additional damage equal to your Charisma Modifier."
