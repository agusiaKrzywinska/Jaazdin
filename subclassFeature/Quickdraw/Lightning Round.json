        "At 10th level, your Quickdraw skills are impeccable. When initiative is rolled, you can expend a use of Shoot to Thrill, and then immediately equip a firearm and make one ranged firearm attack with that weapon at a creature within range. If the attack hits, it is treated as a critical hit."
