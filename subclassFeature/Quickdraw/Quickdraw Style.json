        "When you choose this archetype at 2nd level, you become adept in the Quickdraw style. While wielding two Light firearms, you can engage in two-weapon fighting and add your Dexterity Modifier to the damage of your off hand firearm. For each ranged attack you make with a firearm on your turn, your movement speed is increased by 5ft until the end of the turn. You can reload one handed ranged weapons while your hands are full."
