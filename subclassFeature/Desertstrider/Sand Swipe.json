        "At 3rd level, you can weave sand into your attacks. At the start of your turn, you can fling sand at a creature within 10ft's eyes provided you have a free hand to do so. Your first attack against that target has advantage. You can instead use this at the end of your turn, and the target's next attack before the end of their next turn has disadvantage."
