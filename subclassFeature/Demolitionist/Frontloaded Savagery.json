        "When you choose this archetype at 2nd level, your attacks become lethally savage. Attacking an enemy with a ranged firearm that is 20ft away from you or closer causes the explosives in your firearm to flare out at your enemies, allowing to you to roll the weaponâ€™s damage dice twice and take the higher result. This damage can only be done once per turn.",
