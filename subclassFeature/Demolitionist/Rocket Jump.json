    "At 10th level, you can use your firearms to make a narrow escape. You can expend a use of Shoot to Thrill, and then replace one of your attacks with your Blast Gun with a Rocket Jump, which allows you to immediately fly up to 30ft in an arc in a direction of your choice. This does not provoke opportunity attacks. If there were creatures within 5ft of your starting pointCreatures within 5ft must make a Dexterity Saving Throw (DC equal to 8 + the firearm's tier x2) all creatures hit then take the Blast Gun's damage. You still take falling damage as normal."
