    "At 10th level, your bullets can pierce through creatures. You can expend a use of Shoot to Thrill as a Bonus Action, and for this turn if you hit a creature with a ranged attack with a firearm, the attack continues in a line beyond the target. You use your initial attack roll, add 10 and then subtract the enemyâ€™s AC. If this attack hits a creature behind them, they take the same damage as the initial target. This continues in a line until the bullet reaches a wall or enters its long range."
