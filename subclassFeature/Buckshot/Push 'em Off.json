    "At 10th level, you gain the ability to get foes out of your space. After you use Shrug it Off, if there is a creature within your melee attack range, you can bodycheck them. You expend a use of Shoot to Thrill, and the target creature makes a Strength Saving throw (DC equal to 8 + the firearm you are currently wielding's tier x2). On a fail, they are shoved back up to 10 feet, and then you can immediately make a ranged attack with a firearm against that creature as a part of this action. "
