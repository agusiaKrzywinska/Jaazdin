    "At 6th level, you learn to craft smokebombs. You craft a number of smokebombs equal to your Proficiency Bonus per Long Rest, and can have a number of Smokebombs equal to your Proficiency Bonus. You can replace a ranged attack with a Shotgun firearm with a smokebomb, firing it out of your Shotgun a distance up to its range. The smokebomb then detonates and fills a 10ft radius area with smoke, heavily obscuring it. The smoke remains for a number of rounds equal to your Proficiency Bonus, or until blown away by a strong wind."
