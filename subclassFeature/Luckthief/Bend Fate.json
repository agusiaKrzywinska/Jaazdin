        "At 9th level, you can directly gaze upon and influence the fates around you. You gain the divination spell and can use it once without needing material components or expending a spell slot before having a long rest. When you use this ability, you can then reroll one attack roll, saving throw, or attack roll you make in the next 24 hours, you must use the new result."
