        "At 17th level, you gain the ability to deal a greater wound to someoneâ€™s luck. When you use your Luck Cutter ability you can forgo the bonus and instead choose to cause the next attack roll against the target to be a 20 on the die, and the next attack roll against you to be a 1 on the die. Once you use this ability you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest."
