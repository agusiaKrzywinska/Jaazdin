        "Lesser thieves may steal things like gems, or coins, or identities and while those are within their grasp a Luck Thief concerns themselves with a greater prize, a personâ€™s luck. This ancient art was said to have been founded by an order of mystics who experimented on their assassins to make perfect killers that could cut the cords of fate of their enemies forcing them into a downward spiral of misfortune. Others say that the ability is something inherent, a gift of the bloodline. Others still say it is a blessing from the god of luck. The true origin of this skill is impossible to pin down but the skills of those that wield it is renowned.",
        "Luck Thieves can steal the fortune from their enemies causing them to then fall into disadvantageous positions. Not only that but they are also able to shape their own fate by stealing glances of their future to avoid getting caught in their behavior. The greatest of them are even able to share this wealth with their allies, stealing fortune not just for themselves but for their allies as well.",
