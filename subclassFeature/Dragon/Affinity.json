    "At 14th level, you fully embrace your Draconic abilities. As an Action, you can unleash a pair of Draconic Wings from your body. You gain a flying speed of 80 feet. This lasts for 10 minutes, and you can do this once per long rest.",
    "Furthermore, all beasts you Wild Shape into are treated as Dragons. Whenever you use your Wild Shape, they also gain the aforementioned wings and flying speed. If they already have a flying speed that is slower than 80 ft, it becomes that."
