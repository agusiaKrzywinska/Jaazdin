        "At 6th level, you learn to manipulate the path of projectiles you fire. Once per turn, when you hit with a ranged weapon attack, you deal additional damage on the attack equal to a roll of your martial arts die. In addition, when you make a ranged weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki to make the attack ignore 1⁄2 or 3⁄4 cover or 2 ki to ignore total cover and remove any disadvantage that would affect the attack."
