When you are affected by a spell you can choose to share the effect with your minion as long as it is within 30 feet of you. Also when you fail a saving throw against a negative effect from a spell, such as hold person, and your minion is within 30 feet both you and your minion can use your reactions to have the spell take effect on your minion instead.",
