        "At 6th level, the bond between you and your minion is strengthened to the point where you can share magical effects. When you heal hit points through the casting of a spell your minion regains an equal amount and vice versa. Likewise when you cast a spell that targets only self, it affects your minion as well if they are within 30 feet when you cast it.",
