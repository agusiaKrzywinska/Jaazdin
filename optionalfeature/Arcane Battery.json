        "When a creature casts a spell within 30ft of you that deals damage, you can further enhance it with your own magic. Using your reaction to expend a spell slot you add additional force damage to one of the damage rolls of the spell equal to 2d8 per spell slot expended + half your warden levels. This is added to the spell's damage, meaning spells that save for half damage also halve this additional force damage."
