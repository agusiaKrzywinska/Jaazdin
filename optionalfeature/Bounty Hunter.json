    "You can cast the hunter’s mark spell once per day without expending a spell slot by expending 50gp. By default, it is cast at 1st level, you can expend 100gp to increase the level of the spell by 1. When you kill a creature affected by hunter’s mark cast from this invocation you gain gold equal to 150% of the gold spent casting this spell. Once you have received gold in this way you cannot receive more gold from this invocation until you finish a long rest."
