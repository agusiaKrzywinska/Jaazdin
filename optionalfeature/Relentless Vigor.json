        "As a reaction to failing a saving throw, expend 1 hit die and roll it. You take necrotic damage equal to twice the number rolled which cannot be reduced in any way. You may then reattempt the saving throw with advantage. You may still use Heat of Battle after using this Technique, even if you succeed on the saving throw on the reattempt."
