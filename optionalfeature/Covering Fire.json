        "You forgo an attack to lay down a command of covering fire over an area. Choose a 15ft cube within your ranged weapon's short range. Until the start of your next turn, whenever a creature moves into or exits that area, you or any of your allies within 60ft of the cube can use their reaction to make a single ranged attack against that creature."
