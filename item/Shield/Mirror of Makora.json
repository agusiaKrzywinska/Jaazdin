        "This magical mirror is three feet in diameter and decorated with carvings of monkeys holding the mirror aloft. The mirror is unbreakable and can be used as a shield, granting the wearing +3 AC and advantage on saving throws against spells that deal fire, lightning, radiant, or force damage.",
        "As a bonus action the wielder can throw the shield up to 30 feet at which point it stops, hanging in the air. The wielder can then target the mirror with ranged weapon or spell attacks. When hit, the mirror reflects the attack at a perfect 90 degrees from itself, increasing the damage and the hit of the attack by +1 when it does so and resetting the attack's range. If the attack hit, another mirror is created from the first, also hovering in place. For each subsequent mirror your attack hits, it gains an additional +1 to attack and damage, up to a maximum of +3. You can never have more than three total mirrors at once.",
        "As a bonus action on your turn, you can move any number of your active mirrors up to 30 feet. Your main mirror is immune to all damage however the magically created ones are not, having 16 AC and 5 HP with immunity to fire, lightning, radiant, and force damage. When you return the main mirror to yourself, all remaining mirrors shatter and vanish."
