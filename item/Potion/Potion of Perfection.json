    "This potion looks to be made from liquid gold. Drinking this potion grants the creature near Perfection in everything it does. Any d20 roll on a Skill check that is 7 or lower is treated as an 8. Your Proficiency Bonus is treated as 2 Higher. You gain 1 Legendary Resistance, which is lost after the duration runs out.",
