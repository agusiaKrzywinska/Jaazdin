    "This toolbelt has many heavy duty pockets for on the fly repairs. It can store up to 8 different types of Tools or Kits (Artisan, Gaming, or any item ending in Tools or Kit). You can take out a stored tool once per turn as a Free action, or as an item interaction on the same turn, and if you already have a set of Tools in your hand when you do so, you can store that in the belt as a part of that action."
