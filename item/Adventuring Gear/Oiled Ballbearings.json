    "As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the save."
