        "These ballbearings have been coated in slippery oil. As an Action, you can apply 3 Flasks of Oil to Ball Bearings.",
        "As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesnâ€™t need to make the save."
