        "The hammer constantly hums with the power of the storm and is cloaked in a dark shadow and when called upon can unleash the fury of the storm.",
        "As an action, you can make one melee weapon attack which increases your reach by 30 feet and deals thunder damage instead of bludgeoning damage.",
        "While in darkness or dim light, the maul becomes shrouded in shadow becoming nearly unperceivable. While shrouded in shadow this maul's bludgeoning damage ignores damage resistances.",
        "Additionally, you can use the hammer to cast {@spell thunderwave|PHB} with a DC of 14."
