    "This magical golden lance is adorned with etching of horses dashing through a rising dawn. Attacks made with this lace gain a +3 to attack and damage rolls.",
    "In addition, they deal an extra {@dice 1d10} fire damage on hit. When this lance is used against a Dragon it deals an addition weapon die of damage, and on a critical it adds {@dice 3d6} additional damage.",
    "Once per day, the wielder can hold aloft the lance and use an action to cast {@spell Find Greater Steed|XGE}. When cast in this way, it specifically summons the spirit bonded to the weapon, Rasharam. Rasharam has the statistics of a {@creature nightmare|MM}, but is of type celestial and only the ability to convoy its summoner. When he appears, he is equipped with a saddle and set of plate barding, which vanish with him when he is dismissed or slain. Rasharam remains until dismissed or slain.",
    "Indara’s Fall can only be attuned, identified, and wielded by one who has slain a Dragon of CR 11 or higher. A creature can perform a bonding ritual with the blade by anointing it with CR 11 or high Dragon’s blood. Once this ritual is performed, that creature can always attune to Indara’s Fall.",
    "<b><i>Special.</i></b> You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted."
