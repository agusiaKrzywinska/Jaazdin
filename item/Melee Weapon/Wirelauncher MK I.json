        "A creature can spend 1 minute attaching a javelin to this device. The javelin retains any properties it had before, such as enchantments and rare metal abilities. While attached, the javelin now connects to a canister containing 50ft of thick rope.",
        "The javelin's maximum range cannot exceed how many ft of rope the canister contains. Hitting a creature with the javelin carries the rope with it, allowing you to hold a rope on that creature so long as the javelin remains stuck in the creature. The creature can remove the javelin as an action by making a DC 10 Strength or Dexterity Check."
