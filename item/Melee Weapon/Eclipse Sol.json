        "As a bonus action, the wielder can bring the blade to life, if it is currently day a vibrant golden blade of light springs to life from the hilt, if it is currently night a dark blade of shadow appears instead. The light blade deals {@dice 1d10} Radiant damage and the shadow blade deals {@dice 1d10} necrotic damage. If the blade is summoned during an eclipse, or on a plane that does not have a day or night cycle it instead summons a twilight blade of light and shadow. This blade deals {@dice 1d8} necrotic and {@dice 1d8} radiant.",
        "The blades summoned gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.",
        "When a creature is reduced to zero hit points with this blade a small mote of light breaks off from the blade and orbits the wielders head. This mote can be grasped as a bonus action, allowing the wielder to make a ranged spell attack (+9 to hit) against one creature within 120 feet. The beam deals {@dice 3d12} radiant damage on hit. Up to 4 motes can orbit the wielder at once. If the blade is deactivated or dropped all motes vanish. ",
