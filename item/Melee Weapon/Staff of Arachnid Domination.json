        "The staff allows the wielder to control arachnids, such as spiders and ettercaps, within a certain range.",
        "While holding the staff, the wielder can use an action target to any arachnid within 60 feet. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 15 or be charmed by the wielder for 1 hour. The wielder can use their bonus action on subsequent rounds to maintain control over the charmed creature, causing it to take any actions they desire.",
        "Additionally, once per day, Target up to three creatures within 60 feet. The affected creatures must make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 15 or be magically {@condition restrained} for 1 minute while they struggle to untangle themselves from the web of lies and deceit. The affected creatures can make the save again at the end of their turn.",
