        "By grasping your weapon with both hands, you can use an action to place all your strength on a final gambit against your opponent. If you have advantage on the attack roll, you can attempt to end them in one strike. Make an attack roll without advantage, if the attack hits instead of taking damage, your opponent must make a Constitution saving throw with a +1 for every 10 hit points they have left. If they roll lower than your attack roll, they die instantly. Should they pass the saving throw, you gain one level of exhaustion and an additional level for every 5 above the check they passed."
