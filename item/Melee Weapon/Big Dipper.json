The hook targets another creature of your choice, your size or smaller, within 40 feet. An unwilling creature must make a DC 15 strength saving throw to resist being moved; otherwise, hooked creatures can be moved up to 10 feet in any direction. The hook detaches from a creature at the end of your turn.",
