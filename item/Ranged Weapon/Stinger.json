    "<b><i>Barrel 4.</i></b> A barrel is a chamber that holds a number of rounds. You can spend a Bonus Action to reload a single round in your barrel.",
    "<b><i>Hidden.</i></b> Hidden Firearms are small enough to tuck into a sleeve without it showing an outline and are made for assassinations. Hidden firearms come with a small track that can be mounted to the wielders wrist. As an interaction, they can slide the firearm hidden in their sleeve down the track and right into their hand. Creatures searching you for weapons have disadvantage on finding a Hidden firearm, and you have advantage on Sleight of Hand checks to hide it."
