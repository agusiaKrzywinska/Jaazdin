        "On a successful hit, the Hand-Bomb explodes. All creatures within a 15ft cube of the point of detonation must make a DC 13 DEX Save, taking {@dice 3d4} Force damage on a fail or half on a save (If the bomb detonated while being thrown at a creature, they have disadvantage on the save).",
        "On a miss, the bomb lands at the feet of the targeted creature. The bomb will then detonate after the end of your next turn, or if the bomb would take radiant/force/fire/thunder damage before that point.",
        "The bomb can be picked up and thrown again in this time period, or diffused by making a DC 13 Tinkers Tools (INT/DEX) check. Failing this check immediately detonates the bomb."
