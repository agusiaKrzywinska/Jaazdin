        "<b><i>Pump 4.</i></b> A pump ammo system stores a number of shots directly in the gun. You can reload the barrel with up to 2 slugs as a Bonus Action. Before making an attack with a pump weapon that has more than 1 pump, you can choose to fire up to two shots as a part of the same attack. The first target takes additional damage equal to the weapon's damage die. Pump firearms require a strength score of 13 to reload properly, without this reloading the Firearm is an Action."
