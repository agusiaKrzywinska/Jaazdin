    "<b><i>Belt 20.</i></b> Upon crafting a Belt fed firearm, you additionally gain 1 Belt. Belt fed firearms can make 2 attacks per attack they can make, but do not add your Dexterity Modifier to the damage. Each subsequent attack made with this weapon in one round recieves a -1 to hit. Once a belt is out of ammunition, you can replace and reload the firearm with another loaded belt as an Action. To reload the ammunition in a belt, it requires 1 minute per 10 rounds you are reloading. Belt weapons are prone to jam, and have their misfire score increased by 1."
