        "<b><i>Sniper</i></b> When you make an attack action with this weapon, each attack you could have made with that action is instead consolidated into one attack, where each attack you could have made instead increases the weapon's damage die per attack. Snipers also have disadvantage to hit a creature within 15ft of them.",

To reload a Clip, you can use a Bonus Action to replace your current clip with another loaded clip. A clip can be loaded with its maximum number of rounds by spending 1 minute."
