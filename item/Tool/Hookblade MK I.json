    "This bracer contains a retractable two-pronged climbing tool.",
    "As an action, the wearer can deploy (or retract) the climbing tool by pressing a button (this is considered using an item). While deployed, the wearer had advantage on ability checks made to climb surfaces. Additionally, the wearer can hang from a wall they are climbing with only the hookblade secured into the wall, freeing up a hand."
