        "As a bonus action, the wearer can deploy (or retract) the climbing tool by pressing a button (this is considered using an item). While deployed, the wearer gains a climb speed equal to their walking speed. Additionally, the wearer can hang from a wall they are climbing with only the hookblade secured into the wall, freeing up a hand."
