    "This gemstone is filled with magic from the Plane of Fire. So long as the portal it is connected to remains open, it remains magical. While attuned, you can use this as an Arcane Focus. You ignore Resistance to Fire Damage when dealing Fire Damage with a Spell cast through the Riftgem. Additionally, whenever you cast a spell that expends a spell slot through the Riftgem that would deal Fire Damage, you can have it Burst.",
    "A Spell that Bursts deals additional Fire damage to all creatures within 5ft of those who were affected by the spell. This damage equals {@dice 1d6} for spells of 1st-2nd level, {@dice 2d6} for spells of 3rd-4th level, {@dice 3d6} for spells of 5th-6th level, {@dice 4d6} for spells of 7th-8th level, and {@dice 5d6} for spells of 9th level.",
    "Finally, while within 60ft of the portal this gem is connected to, you gain resistance to Fire Damage."
