    "A Mere'su'ra puzzle box is a cube-shaped container 5 to 6 inches on a side, composed of airtight, interlocking parts made from materials found in the ancient civilization of Mere'su'ra. Most of these boxes are made of gold, though some are crafted from bronze or ivory. Puzzle boxes from Mere'su'ra were typically used as a pass time for scholars and something to keep treasured belongings. An empty puzzle box weighs 3 pounds regardless of the materials used to fashion it.",
    "When an object small enough to fit inside a puzzle box is placed in it, the container magically seals shut around the object, and no magic can force the box open. The sealed box becomes immune to all damage as well. Every Mere'su'ra puzzle box is constructed with a unique means of opening it. The trick to solving the puzzle is always mundane, never magical. Once a creature figures out the trick or sequence of steps needed to open a particular puzzle box, that creature can open the box as an action, allowing access to the box's contents.",
    "Alternatively, a creature that has discovered the trick to the puzzle box may open the box to cast {@spell fortune's favor|EGW} or {@spell time lock|TftJC} once per long rest.",
    "A creature that spends 1 hour holding a puzzle box while trying to open it can make a DC 30 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If the check succeeds, the creature figures out the trick or sequence of steps needed to open the box. If the check fails by 10 or more, the creature must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw, taking {@dice 12d6} psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one."
