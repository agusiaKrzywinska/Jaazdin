They last for 10 minutes, or until they drop to 0 hitpoints. They require no corpse or skeleton to summon, and leave no trace that they were ever here once they are gone."

The charm lasts for 1 hour after it leaves your sight. While charmed, you think only how you can take it and that you must have it. The charm can also end once you successfully claim the gold or gems.",
