    "This Modification contains magical energy allowing the wearer to mold their spells. Upon being crafted, it contains 1 Metamagic (determined during crafting). When you activate this Modification, you additionally expend the highest level spell slot you have remaining, and gain a number of charges equal to half its spell level (rounded down, minimum 1). These charges can then be spent while the modification remains active to utilize the Metamagic within it. After 1 minute, or when the charges are all spent, the Modification loses its energy and is depleted until it is recharged."
