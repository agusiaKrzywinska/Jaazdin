    "This metal orb hovers around the user and requires no hands to wield. The Orb retains its magical properties while within 120ft of its owner, and leaving this radius causes it to slowly hover back to its owner at 30ft per round. Upon casting a 1st level spell or higher, the attuned can move the Orb up to 30ft (before or after the spell is cast).",
    "It grants a +2 to your Spell Save DC and Spell attack rolls. The orb can be fitted with 4 plates of a Rare Metal (requiring 1 hour of work and smiths tools in hand, no downtime required), granting the effects of their Weapon Bonus to your Spell attack rolls if it can be properly applied. The plates can also be removed by spending an hour.",
