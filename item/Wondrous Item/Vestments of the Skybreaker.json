        "When you make an attack using the Attack action and hit, you may make an additional attack with the same weapon and against the same target. If the attack hits, it does its normal damage roll, but the target takes half that amount as force damage. Whenever you deal damage to a creature with a ranged attack, you gain +5ft of movement speed until the end of your turn."
