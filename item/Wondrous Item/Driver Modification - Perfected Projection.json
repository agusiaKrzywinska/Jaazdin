    "When a creature of a CR equal to or less than your Proficiency Bonus within 30ft of you dies, you can use a Reaction to present this Modification, and have the Modification scan them. A part of their essence is absorbed into the Driver Modification. This can only be done when the Modification is not inserted into an energy driver. You can have a number of Essences stored in the Modification at a time equal to your Proficiency Bonus, scanning more removes a previous scan from your Modifier. When you activate this Modification, it creates a spectral version of a creature of your choice scanned within the Modifier. The Scan is then deleted. That creature is loyal to you, follows your commands and lasts for 1 minute or until their hp is reduced to 0. They have half of their normal maximum hp when summoned this way."
