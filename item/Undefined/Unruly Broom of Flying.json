        "This wooden broom, which weighs 3 pounds, functions like a mundane broom until you stand astride it and speak its command word. It then hovers beneath you and can be ridden in the air. It has a flying speed of 50 feet. It can carry up to 400 pounds, but its flying speed becomes 30 feet while carrying over 200 pounds. The broom stops hovering when you land.",
        "You can send the broom to travel alone to a destination within 1 mile of you if you speak the command word, name the location, and are familiar with that place. The broom comes back to you when you speak another command word, provided that the broom is still within 1 mile of you.",
        "Unruly (Curse). Whenever you speak the command word for this broom, roll a {@dice 1d6}.",
        "On a 1-3 the broom is unruly and to remain on it, you must make a DC 15 Acrobatics check at the start of your turn or fall off the broom. On a 4-5, the broom is malicious, while on it attack rolls against you have advantage on you, and you have disadvantage on all Dexterity saving throws and ability checks. On a 6, the broom is compliant and performs as normal.",
        "A creature can use an action to make a DC 15 Animal Handling check on the broom. If the broom is Unruly or Malicious, it becomes compliant for the next hour, otherwise it cannot be changed until after an hour passes. While Unruly or Malicious, the broom may perform mischievous actions like knocking things off of shelves or attempting to trip the user. Unless the broom is compliant, it remains active for 1 hour, even if you say its command word."
