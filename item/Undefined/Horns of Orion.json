    "These gold and crystal horns once belonged to Orion, famed protector of Alsorn. They grant their wielder supernatural sense. These horns must be attached to a set of Medium or Heavy armor to function. Once attached, the wearer gains proficiency in Perception and can add their proficiency bonus to initiative rolls.",
    "While attached, the horns warn the wearer of incoming danger. You gain advantage on Dexterity saving throw against effects you can see, cannot be surprised, and creatures cannot gain advantage against you from flanking you.",
    "As an action, you can touch the horns to grant yourself 5ft of truesight. This effect lasts for 1 hour or until you use a bonus action to turn it off. Once you use this ability, it cannot be used until you finish a long rest."
