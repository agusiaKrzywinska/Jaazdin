        "<b><i>Cursed.</i></b> This amulet is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the amulet, insisting on wearing it at all times. You cannot unattune to the amulet while cursed in this way. A {@spell remove curse|PHB} or similar magic immediately unattunes the wearer, ending the curse.",

Additionally, the wearer staunchly believes the amulet brings them good luck, and becomes hostile towards those who would attempt to remove them of the amulet."
