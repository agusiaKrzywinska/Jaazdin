        "As a bonus action, the wearer of the ring can conjure a ghostly pie and attempt to smash it in the face of a creature within melee range (improvised weapon attack). On a hit, the pie explodes in the creature’s face, blinding them for one turn and dealing {@dice 1d4} force damage. If the attack misses and there’s a creature directly behind the original target, another attack is made against this new target.",

        "Ghost pie can only be eaten by ghosts. It goes well with ghost vanilla ice cream."
