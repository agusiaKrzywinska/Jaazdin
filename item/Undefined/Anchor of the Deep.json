        "The Anchor of the Deep appears to be an old, rusted anchor covered in intricate, weathered runes. When this anchor is used, it triggers a powerful magical effect that causes the entire ship to sink rapidly to the bottom of the sea. However, rather than resulting in tragedy, the occupants of the ship find themselves under the effect of the water breathing spell.",
        "<b><i>Breath of the Depths.</i></b> Once per long rest, as an action, you can embed the Anchor of the Deep into the deck of a ship or a similar structure. When activated, the anchor triggers a powerful enchantment that causes the ship to sink quickly to the ocean floor, also everyone currently on the ship will gain the effects of the {@spell water breathing|PHB} spell as if the spell was casted on them. This lasts for 24 hours or until the anchor is retrieved and the ship resurfaces. To resurface the ship, as an action the user attuned to it must retrieve the anchor. Once the anchor is lifted, the ship ascends back to the surface, breaking the water's surface and returning to its normal state. It takes 1 minute to sink to the bottom or to float back up. The ship is unharmed from when it sinks."
