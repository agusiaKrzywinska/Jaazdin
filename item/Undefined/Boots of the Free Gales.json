Additionally, you feel uncomfortable in confined places, and you suffer disadvantage on Wisdom ability checks and saving throws while indoors or underground.",
        "<b><i>Shackles of Carreshal.</i></b> This item contains the spirit of a destructive elemental tempest known as Elitanith. While this cloak is not being worn by someone the enchantment magic holding Elitanith at bay begins to wane.
