        "When you break an Egg of Seeking, it reveals the location of any purposefully hidden objects, entrances, containers, persons, and the like within 100 feet for one minute.

The hunter of such should then easily be able to poach the location(s) of what is hidden as long as it resides on the same plane of existence."
