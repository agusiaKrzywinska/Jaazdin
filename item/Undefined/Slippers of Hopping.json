        "Fluffy and warm, these slippers add 10 feet to the base jump distance of the wearer, even from a standing position. Additionally, they grant the user +1 to all acrobatics checks.",
        "<b><i>Good Hare Day.</i></b> Once per day, the wearer of the Slippers of Hopping may boop the noses of their footwear as a bonus action. When this happens, wearer casts Jump upon themselves and triples their jump distance for one minute. For the duration, long rabbit-like ears sprout from the head of the wearer, though the ears may be slicked back if the wearer has a receding hareline. Additionally, every jump is accompanied by a loud “BOING”!",
        "Unfortunately, while wearing the Slippers of Hopping, the user is compelled to do the embarrassing action that bunnies are known for...twitch their nose."
