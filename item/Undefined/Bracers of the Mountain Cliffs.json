        "<b><i>Shackles of Jurajuru.</i></b> This item contains the spirit of a destructive elemental zaratan known as Cavalkal. While these bracers are not being worn by someone the enchantment magic binding Cavalkal to them begins to wane. After {@dice 1d6+2} days the bracers vanish and transform into a portal into the Elemental Plane of Earth. After {@dice 2d4+2} days the magic fails entirely and Cavalkal is freed. The bracers currently feel empty, it does not appear that Cavalkal is binded within them."
