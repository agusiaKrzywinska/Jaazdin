        "A small pouch containing Morenstar Lake's special Shiny Bait, a glimmering gem-like item that has little value by itself, but is easily confused as valuable to the casual observer.",
        "As a bonus action, a creature can remove one piece of bait and throw it up to 30 feet away.",
        "If it lands within 30 feet of another creature, that creature must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw at the start of their next turn. On a fail, they must move up to their speed towards the bait and pick it up. The creature is not compelled to move in a way that obviously endangers them; for instance, over a cliff or through a known hazard. If the creature picks it up, succeeds on their saving throw, or if the bait is unreachable, they immediately discern it as a worthless item and are immune to this effect until the next dawn.",
        "The bag contains up to 3 pieces of bait. 1 piece of bait reappears in the bag each day at dawn."
