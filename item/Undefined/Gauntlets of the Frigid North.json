        "While you wear both of these steel gauntlets, any non-magical weapon you grasp with either gauntlet is treated as a magic weapon.",
        "As a bonus action, you can use the gauntlets to cause ice to envelop one or two melee weapons in your grasp. Each icy weapon deals an extra {@dice 1d6} cold damage on a hit. The ice last until you sheath or let go of either weapon. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.",
