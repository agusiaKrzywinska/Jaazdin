    "This magical modification can be slotted into a gun to grant it the magical effects placed on it. Any enchantment that can be placed on a weapon can be placed on a magic capacitor. Once installed on a gun, it grants that gun the enchantment. A magic capacitor can only be placed on a non-magical gun, otherwise it has no effect.",
