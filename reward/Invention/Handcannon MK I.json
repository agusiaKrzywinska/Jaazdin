        "This miniature cannon can be wielded effectively with two hands, like a heavy crossbow.",
        "Proficiency in the Heavy Crossbow allows you to add your proficiency bonus with this weapon.",
        "It uses small cannonballs as ammunition, 10 of which can be bought for 5gp.",
        "As an Action, the wielder can ignite the fuse on the end of the cannon and fire it. Make a ranged attack roll (range 120ft, with no long range). It travels in that line until it hits a creature's AC, or it reaches the end of its range. A Creature hit by this attack takes {@dice 4d10} + DEX Bludgeoning Damage.",
        "It requires 3 Actions to Reload. If the wielder has the Crossbow Master Feat, this is lowered to 2."
