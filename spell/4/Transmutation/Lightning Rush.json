While this spell is active, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action, you donâ€™t provoke attacks of opportunity, and any creatures you move through must make a DEX Save. On a fail, they take {@dice 3d6} lightning damage and are knocked prone, or half as much on a success. When the spell ends, your hair becomes frizzy."
