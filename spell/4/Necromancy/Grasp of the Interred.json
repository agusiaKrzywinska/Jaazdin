Each creature must make a Constitution saving throw or take {@dice 4d12} necrotic damage and become restrained. On a success, they take half damage and are not restrained. For the duration of the spell, the area becomes difficult terrain and a creature that ends its turn inside must make a Constitution saving throw or take {@dice 2d12} necrotic damage, half as much on a success. When the spell ends, the difficult terrain vanishes and any restrained creatures are released."
