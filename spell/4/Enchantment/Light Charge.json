        "You launch forth an intense ball of light. Creatures within its radius have their movement speed halved. As a Bonus Action on a subsequent turns after casting the spell, you can cause the light burst, which ends its effects. Creatures within the cube must make a Constitution Saving Throw, and on a fail take {@dice 4d6} radiant damage, or half as much to creatures that pass the saving throw. Each turn you are concentrating on the spell, it deals an additional {@dice 1d6} radiant damage when it bursts. If you would lose concentration on the spell at any time, it immediately bursts"
