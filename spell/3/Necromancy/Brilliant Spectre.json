        "You transmute a lantern's flame into a Will-o'-Wisp. The Will-o'-Wisp is friendly to you, and remains for the spell's duration or once its hit points become 0. As a bonus action on your turn, you can command the Will-o'-Wisp to perform an action. Additionally, you can give the Will-o'-Wisp a command once a certain event happens, like 'Notify me if anyone enters this area' or 'Attack any undead you see'. You can have up to three Will-o'-Wisp under your control at a time from this spell's effects. If you already have three Will-o'-Wisps under your control and you cast this spell again, that new Will-o'-Wisp becomes hostile towards you."
