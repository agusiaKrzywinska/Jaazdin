Make a spell attack roll against that creature, and on a hit they take {@dice 4d10} slashing damage as rapidly moving petals tear around them. If this attack hits a creature, that creature is also restrained, as the petals turn to solid chains. If the spell hits, then all creatures of your choice within 10ft of that creature must make a Dexterity Saving throw, or also be restrained. Creatures restrained by this spell are freed at the end of your next turn."
