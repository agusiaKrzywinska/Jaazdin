As a bonus action on your turn, you can hurl one of the blades at a target within range. Make a ranged spell attack, on a hit the target takes {@dice 2d8} magical slashing damage. The blade is then destroyed. You can instead of hurling the blade, grasp it, and make a melee spell attack which does {@dice 2d10} magical slashing damage on hit. For each blade remaining creatures that end their turn within 5ft of you take {@dice 1d4} magical slashing."
