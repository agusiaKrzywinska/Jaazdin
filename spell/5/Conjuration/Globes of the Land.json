    "You designate two 15ft radius spheres within range and swap the contents of them. Each creature in the sphere moves to a new location in the other sphere of your choice along with everything they are wearing and carrying. An unwilling creature must make a Charisma saving throw, on a success they are not moved. Objects are also moved unless they are affixed to the ground, such as a plant, or are not fully inside the radius, such as a cart that is halfway into the radius."
