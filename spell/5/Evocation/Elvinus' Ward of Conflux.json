    "You conjure a ward of primal energy that surrounds your body and protects you from elemental magics. Choose one element from fire, cold, lightning, thunder, or acid damage. You gain resistance to that damage type. When you take damage from one of the listed damage types you can use your reaction to gain resistance to that damage type for the rest of the duration of the spell including the inciting instance of damage. Every time you use your reaction to switch resistances it replaces the previous resistance. In addition, any melee attacks that you hit with deal an extra {@dice 2d10} of the element you are currently resistant to."
