        "You create a raging tornado within range. The tornado has a diameter of 20ft, and a height of 100ft. As a Bonus Action on your turn, you can move the tornado up to 30ft in a straight line. Creatures that enter the tornado or start their turn within the tornado must make a Strength Saving throw, and on a fail are flung up into the air inside of the tornado. Creatures affected by the tornado take {@dice 5d4} bludgeoning damage when they fail the saving throw, and cannot concentrate on spells, fail dexterity saving throws, cannot use a fly speed if they have one and are deafened. Creatures affected are flung a number of feet into the air equal to 1d10 x 10 when they start their turn. If a creature goes higher than the top of the tornado, they are shot out of the top of the tornado in a random direction and fall. They fly a number of feet equal to the remaining distance they would have travelled upwards."
