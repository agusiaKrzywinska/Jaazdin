        "You conjure a reflective metallic sphere in range. The sphere is 1ft in radius and hovers 5ft above the ground. It emits a magnetic force in a 45ft radius of the sphere that pulls in metal objects. Upon casting the spell, entering its zone for the first time, or starting your turn within its zone,loose metal objects within the magnetic force are flung towards the sphere and stick to it for the duration of the spell. Metal objects that are held require the wielder to make a Strength Save, and on a fail the objects are flung towards the sphere and stick to it. To retrieve an object stuck on the sphere, a creature must make a Strength Check equal to the spell save DC to successfully remove them from the sphere.",
        "Creatures wearing metal armor are more susceptible to its effects. A creature wearing medium armor made primarily of metal must make a Strength Save, and on a fail, their body is flung towards the sphere and will then be stuck to it. A creature wearing light armor also makes the save, but with advantage. A creature wearing heavy armor makes the save with disadvantage. While stuck to the sphere, the creature is considered restrained. A creature may attempt an Athletics check to remove itself or another creature stuck to the sphere. The same advantages and disadvantages as detailed above depending on the armor type applies to this check.",
        "Creatures that are pulled to the centre of the sphere by its effect take fall damage equivalent of the range traveled. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level, when casting the spell you can instead have the orb repulse objects made of metal. Objects are then instead flung outwards of the sphereâ€™s zone of magnetism. Creatures wearing armor are still affected by the same advantages and disadvantages as detailed above."
