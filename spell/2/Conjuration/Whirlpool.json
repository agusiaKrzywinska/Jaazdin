    "You conjure a rapid pool of twisting water at a point within range. Creatures within a 15ft cube must make a strength saving throw. On a fail, they take {@dice 3d10} bludgeoning damage and are moved as close to the centre of the cube as they can. If they would knock into another creature, both creatures take {@dice 1d6} bludgeoning damage. If this spell is cast affecting creatures in water, they have disadvantage on the saving throw."
