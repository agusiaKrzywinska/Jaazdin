Before ingesting the Potion, a hair, nail or other small piece of a creature is to be mixed in with the completed Potion, after which time it glows with Chronurgic Magic. Ingesting the potion allows you to peer through that creature's life. You experience any event they would have from their point of view.",

Within that time, you are {@condition blinded}, {@condition deafened} and {@condition incapacitated}. A creature can resist these effects if they do not want to be under the potion's effects, making a DC 19 INT save, repeating this saving throw each hour that passes or when they take damage. The events are played out backwards, meaning more recent events happen in the first hours, and the beginning of the creature's life happens at the end of the vision. This potion's effects cannot be ended early, unless with a 9th level {@spell Dispel Magic|PHB} or by making the above saving throw. The potion provides no effect to creatures that are dead or undead."

                "You conjure a reflective metallic sphere in range. The sphere is 1ft in radius and hovers 5ft above the ground. It emits a magnetic force in a 45ft radius of the sphere that pulls in metal objects. Upon casting the spell, entering its zone for the first time, or starting your turn within its zone,loose metal objects within the magnetic force are flung towards the sphere and stick to it for the duration of the spell. Metal objects that are held require the wielder to make a Strength Save, and on a fail the objects are flung towards the sphere and stick to it. To retrieve an object stuck on the sphere, a creature must make a Strength Check equal to the spell save DC to successfully remove them from the sphere.",

A creature wearing medium armor made primarily of metal must make a Strength Save, and on a fail, their body is flung towards the sphere and will then be stuck to it. A creature wearing light armor also makes the save, but with advantage. A creature wearing heavy armor makes the save with disadvantage. While stuck to the sphere, the creature is considered {@condition restrained}. A creature may attempt an {@skill Athletics} check to remove itself or another creature stuck to the sphere. The same advantages and disadvantages as detailed above depending on the armor type applies to this check.",

If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level, when casting the spell you can instead have the orb repulse objects made of metal. Objects are then instead flung outwards of the sphere’s zone of magnetism. Creatures wearing armor are still affected by the same advantages and disadvantages as detailed above."
