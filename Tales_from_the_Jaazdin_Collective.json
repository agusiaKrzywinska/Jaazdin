It emits a magnetic force in a 45ft radius of the sphere that pulls in metal objects. Upon casting the spell, entering its zone for the first time, or starting your turn within its zone,loose metal objects within the magnetic force are flung towards the sphere and stick to it for the duration of the spell. Metal objects that are held require the wielder to make a Strength Save, and on a fail the objects are flung towards the sphere and stick to it. To retrieve an object stuck on the sphere, a creature must make a Strength Check equal to the spell save DC to successfully remove them from the sphere.",

A creature wearing medium armor made primarily of metal must make a Strength Save, and on a fail, their body is flung towards the sphere and will then be stuck to it. A creature wearing light armor also makes the save, but with advantage. A creature wearing heavy armor makes the save with disadvantage. While stuck to the sphere, the creature is considered restrained. A creature may attempt an Athletics check to remove itself or another creature stuck to the sphere. The same advantages and disadvantages as detailed above depending on the armor type applies to this check.",

As your Gun Tier levels up, your weapon is upgraded into its next tier by paying for the upgrade cost and spending 1 hour using your Gunsmith's Tools. The Blast Gun has unique modifications, which are unlocked at level 5, and these modifications can be upgraded at level 13 by paying the gold cost and spending 4 hours of work. These modifications can be attacked to the Blast Gun to allow it to perform new attacks. These new attacks have separate ranges, damage types, and use their own ammunition.",
