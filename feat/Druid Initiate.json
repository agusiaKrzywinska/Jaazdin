You can stay in this form for up to an hours and you cannot chose a form with an innate fly speed. This ability recharges upon long rest.",

You can cast this spell once per day without expending a spell slot, but can cast it additional times by expending a use of your Wildshape. Both the cantrip and 1st level spell granted from this feat can be cast while Wildshaped."
